## __smartASS (smartphone - Alternative Software Setups)__ ##

This repository has the purpose to open the horizon for lazy but sensibilized smartphone users to install alternative software and
use basic smartphone apps of alternative (open source) origin. The main focus is on privacy and the "keep your own data"-strategy.

Sometimes a complete solution is presented, sometimes alternatives are just outlined and discussed..

Everyone is welcomed to contribute, just open an issue on the repository page.

Thanks, enjoy and spread the word!
